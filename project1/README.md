Technologies Used

I utilized HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

Possible Enhancements

I would like to enhance the game by checking the size of the image before loading to ensure it is not a very small image which will be hard for the end user to view. I would also like to add some mini-game between rounds where the user can bet their current points and play the mini-game (e.g. 21, three-card-monte, etc.).
